Scavenger-s-Rift
================
The game was a personal project over the summer of 2013. I created the game to help me learn how to code in Java.
I wrote most of the code after I took two courses in Object Oriented Programming. 

I made three versions of the game.

SR1.1 was before I knew about classes, it is contained within 1 class. 1500 lines of code.
SR1.2 was wear the bulk of my code lies. It has 9 classes and has about 2500 lines of code.
SR1.3 is the current version. It was started after I learned about polymorphism and I wanted to use it to organise the code.
I also created save files in this version and 1 game mechanic and some menu options.
